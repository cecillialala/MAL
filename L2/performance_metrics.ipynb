    "\n",
    "Maybe performance _score_ would be a better name than performance metric, at least for the accuracy, precision, recall we will be looking at---emphasising the conceptual distinction between the  _score-function_ and _cost(/loss/error/objective)-function_ (the later is typically a true distance/norm function).  \n",
